ReactPhysics3D is an open source C++ physics engine library that can be used in 3D simulations and games. The library is released under the ZLib license.

ReactPhysics3D has the following features :

- Rigid body dynamics
- Discrete collision detection
- Collision shapes (Sphere, Box, Cone, Cylinder, Capsule, Convex Mesh)
- Broadphase collision detection (Sweep and Prune using AABBs)
- Narrowphase collision detection (GJK/EPA)
- Collision response and friction (Sequential Impulses Solver)
- Joints (Ball and Socket, Hinge, Slider, Fixed)
- Sleeping technique for inactive bodies
- Integrated Profiler
- Multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
- Documentation (User manual and Doxygen API)
- Examples
- Unit tests
